    "The aim of this project was to use machine learning methods to forecast the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients over the next 10 years. The researchers used data from an ongoing cardiovascular study conducted on residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset contained details of more than 4,000 patients and had 15 different attributes, each representing a possible factor contributing to the risk of CHD. These attributes covered information about the patients' demographics, behaviors, and medical conditions that could affect the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analyzing the data, data preprocessing has been done. It involved cleaning and changing the data to make it easier to work with. One important step was dealing with missing values, where some information was not available for some patients. Different techniques were used to estimate these missing values, such as using the middle value (median) of similar data, the most common value (mode), or a method called KNN imputation. Outliers, which are unusual or extreme values that could affect the analysis, were also identified and removed from the data. This was done using a method called Interquartile Range (IQR). To improve the accuracy of the analysis, certain continuous variables that were unevenly distributed were transformed. For example, they were changed using mathematical functions like logarithms or square roots to make the data more balanced and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the chosen features are not highly related to each other (reducing redundancy), a method called variance inflation factor was used to detect and remove multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when some features are highly correlated, making it challenging for the model to distinguish their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a new feature named \"pulse pressure\" was created to capture the relationship between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This newly derived feature can be valuable in understanding the impact of blood pressure on CHD risk. After the feature selection process, some columns that were found to be redundant were removed to simplify the dataset and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "The most important features, based on their impact on predicting CHD risk, were identified as 'age', 'sex', 'education', 'cigs_per_day', 'bp_meds' (blood pressure medications usage), 'prevalent_stroke', 'prevalent_hyp' (prevalent hypertension), 'diabetes', 'total_cholesterol', 'bmi' (body mass index), 'heart_rate', 'glucose', and 'pulse_pressure'. These selected features can be used to build a more effective model to predict the risk of coronary heart disease in patients based on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the dataset was imbalanced, meaning there were more examples of one class (patients without CHD risk) than the other class (patients with CHD risk). To address this issue, a combination of two techniques, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Tomek links undersampling, was used. This balanced the class distribution and improved the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that all features had the same scale and to avoid any bias towards specific features, the data was scaled using the standard scalar method. Several machine learning models were tested to see how well they performed in predicting CHD risk. The main evaluation metric used was \"recall,\" which measures the ability of the model to correctly identify patients with CHD risk. After thorough analysis, the Neural Network model, which was fine-tuned for better performance, was selected as the final prediction model. It had the highest recall score among all the evaluated models. By prioritizing a high recall score, the aim was to correctly identify as many patients at risk of CHD as possible, even if it meant having some false positives. Overall, the project demonstrated the potential of machine learning to accurately predict CHD risk in patients based on data from a cardiovascular study. Through careful data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, it was possible to achieve positive results by effectively predicting CHD risk in patients."

    "* **Outlier Handling:** Once outliers are identified, they can be treated in different ways. In the code example, we chose to replace the outliers with the upper or lower bound value.
